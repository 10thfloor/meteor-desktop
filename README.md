# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Meteor Desktop
###### aka Meteor Electron Desktop Client
> Build desktop apps with Meteor & Electron. Full integration with hot code push implementation.

```bash
 cd /your/meteor/app
 npm install --save-dev meteor-desktop
 meteor-desktop
```

## What is this?

This is a complete implementation of integration between `Meteor` and `Electron`. To make it clear from the start, this is a **desktop client** - it is just like your mobile clients - but for desktops. It also features a full hot code push implementation - which means you can release updates the same way you are used to.

## Prerequisites

 - Meteor >= `1.3.3`
 -
